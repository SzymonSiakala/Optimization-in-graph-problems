# Optimization in graph problems
In this project, I implemented Dijkstra's algorithm to solve the least cost path problem.

### Input data:
- weighted graph structure defined by adjacency matrix G,
- initial node S,
- target node T

### The result of the program:
- the least cost path defined by a sequence of transitions between nodes starting from S to T,
- value of the least cost.

### Outcome:
After running the program, the following figure will be generated:
