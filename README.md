# Optimization in graph problems
In this project, I implemented Dijkstra's algorithm to solve the least cost path problem.

### Input data:
- weighted graph structure defined by adjacency matrix G,
- initial node S,
- target node T

### The result of the program:
- the least cost path defined by a sequence of transitions between nodes starting from S to T,
- value of the least cost.

### Outcome:
After starting the program, the adjacency matrix and city coordinates will be read from the csv files. Then the application will randomly select two cities and use the Dijkstra algorithm to determine the shortest path. At the end, a map is generated.
